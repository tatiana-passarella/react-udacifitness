# Udacifitness

This project is the exercise of the third module on React Native of the [Udacity's React course](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

Is a Triathlon tracker app, this app is a scheduler where you can add per day your progress about of triathlon (run, swim, and bike) that you done and the time that you slept and rating your foods.

## How to start the app

After cloning this project, you have to install and run the app:
```
cd react-native-udacifitness
yarn install
yarn start
```

You should use the Expo app on your phone or install a simulator on your computer. If you decide to use a simulator, I suggest using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/). After installing it, you can follow the guide [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/genymotion.html), so that `exp` can communicate with Genymotion. Once everything is installed and Genymotion is running, hit the "_a_" button to open Android emulator, or "_i_" to open iOS emulator.

Otherwhise, if you have Expo app installed on your phone, you can point it to the generated QR code (you'll find the QR scanner on the Projects tab of the app).

The app will look like this:
